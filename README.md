## What the schnack?

Features:
- Tiny! It takes only ~**8 KB!!!** to embed Schnack.
- **Open source** and **self-hosted**.
- Ad-free and Tracking-free. Schnack will **not disturb your users**.
- It's simpy to moderate, with a **minimal** and **slick UI** to allow/reject comments or trust/block users.
- **[webpush protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-webpush-protocol-12) to notify the site owner** about new comments awaiting for moderation.
- **Third party providers for authentication** like Github, Twitter, Google and Facebook. Users are not required to register a new account on your system and you don't need to manage a user management system.

### Quickstart
